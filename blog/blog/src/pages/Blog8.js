            Quentin Tarantino’s "Pulp Fiction" revolutionized modern filmmaking with its non-linear narrative, combining multiple storylines in a way that had never been done before. Released in 1994, the film became an instant classic, known for its memorable dialogue, eccentric characters, and iconic scenes.

            "Pulp Fiction" doesn’t follow a traditional plot structure. Instead, it intertwines several seemingly unrelated stories — from a hitman’s philosophical musings to a couple’s robbery — creating a film that keeps audiences on the edge of their seat. Tarantino’s use of out-of-order storytelling became one of the most distinctive aspects of the film, inspiring countless other directors.
