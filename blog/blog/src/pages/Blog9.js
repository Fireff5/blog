            Horror has always been a genre that pushes the boundaries of cinema, evoking fear, suspense, and shock. From Alfred Hitchcock’s "Psycho" (1960), which set the standard for psychological horror, to Ari Aster’s "Hereditary" (2018), which redefined modern horror with a focus on family trauma, the genre has continually evolved over the decades.

            "Psycho" is a landmark in horror, changing the way audiences perceive violence on screen and influencing generations of filmmakers. Meanwhile, "Hereditary" takes a more psychological and disturbing approach to horror, focusing on grief, trauma, and family secrets rather than relying on traditional jump scares.
