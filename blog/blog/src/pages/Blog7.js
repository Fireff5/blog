            In 1995, Pixar’s "Toy Story" revolutionized the animation industry by introducing fully computer-generated animation. The film’s innovative use of CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) allowed for more dynamic visuals, creating a whole new world for animated films. "Toy Story" was not just a technical achievement; it also told an emotionally rich and relatable story that appealed to audiences of all ages.
